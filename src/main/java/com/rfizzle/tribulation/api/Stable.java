/**
 * Marks a type as part of Tribulation's stable public API surface, governed by
 * the Concord API Standard v1: stable across patch and minor versions, breaking
 * changes only with a major version bump and a changelog entry.
 *
 * <p>This is the suite's intended {@code @ApiStatus.Stable} marker. JetBrains'
 * {@code org.jetbrains.annotations.ApiStatus} has no {@code Stable} member (it
 * only ships {@code Internal}, {@code Experimental}, etc.), so the marker is
 * declared locally — consistent with Concord's convention-over-dependency rule
 * that {@code api} package code is duplicated per mod, never shared as a
 * runtime library.
