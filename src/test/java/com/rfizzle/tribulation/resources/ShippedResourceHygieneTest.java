/**
 * Guards the boundary between what ships and what only ever serves a test.
 *
 * <p>Gametest fixtures — structure templates and bespoke loot tables — resolve through the
 * merged {@code ResourceManager} by namespace, so they work from any loaded mod's resource
 * root. That means they belong in the gametest source set, whose manifest declares a separate
 * {@code tribulation-gametest} mod that never enters the jar.
 *
 * <p>Keeping them out of the shipped roots is worth a guard on two counts. A loot table in the
 * {@code tribulation} namespace is eagerly parsed and validated on every datapack reload on every
 * server, including the integrated server behind a singleplayer world, purely to serve a test.
 * A structure template is cheaper — it loads on demand rather than on reload — but it is still
 * listed for {@code /place template} autocomplete, so it surfaces test fixtures to operators.
 *
 * <p>These assertions read the test classpath rather than the source tree, because the
 * classpath is what the jar is built from — it is the shipped artifact under test.
